# php-sql-project

During Information Systems and Databases course, we built a restaurant website with Chef Express database.

We used php (backend), sql, html and css.
In order to open the website you should use xampp:
1. Run the ChefExpress - SQL Server script
2. Put the other files in the htdocs folder
3. open http://localhost/
